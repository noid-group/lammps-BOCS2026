The only argument following *table/lin* or *table/spline* or *table/gradlin* or *table/gradspline* is the filename for the table.
Example tables are used for *potential table/x* and *gradient table/gradx* in the ``examples/PACKAGES/ldd`` system.

Description
"""""""""""
This family of arguments can follow the *gradient* or *potential* keywords in the ldd pair_coeff command.
Following the *potential* keyword, these options control the functional form for :math:`U_{\rho}` and :math:`F_{\rho} = -\frac{dU_{\rho}}{d\rho}`
Following the *gradient* keyword, these options control the functional form for :math:`U_{\nabla}` and :math:`F_{\nabla} = -\frac{dU_{\nabla}}{d\rho}`.

All table commands use either a 4th order (*table/spline* and *table/gradspline*) or a second order (*table/lin* and *table/gradlin*) spline in order to represent the function :math:`U_X`.

In principle, if :math:`U_X` is an :math:`n^{\text{th}}` order polynomial in :math:`\rho`, then :math:`F_{X} = -\frac{dU_{X}}{d\rho}` should be an :math:`n - 1` order polynomial.

In the case of LD potentials :math:`U_X = U_{\rho}`, :math:`U_{\rho}` does not appear in the pair additive force expression (See DeLyser 2019), and therefore does not influence the forces or sampling.
Consequently, it does not influence sampling if :math:`U_\rho` and :math:`F_\rho` are described by polynomials of the same order. (args *table/lin* and *table/spline* do this.)

However, in the case of SG potentials, both :math:`U_{\nabla}` and :math:`F_{\nabla} = -\frac{dU_{\nabla}}{d\rho}` directly contribute to the forces (See DeLyser 2021).
Consequently it is necessary that :math:`F_{\nabla}` is represented with a lower order polynomial than :math:`U_{\nabla}` in order to sample the correct equilibrium distribution.
(args *table/gradlin* and *table/gradspline* do this.)


Thus, while e.g. *table/lin* and *table/gradlin* can be used somewhat interchangeably to generate forces following the *potential* keyword, the *gradient* keyword should only be used with the *table/gradlin* and *table/gradspline* keywords.


Args *table/lin* and *table/spline* read in a file containing three columns: :math:`\rho`, :math:`U`, :math:`F`.
E.g. For a LD potential these three columns should be :math:`\rho` :math:`U_{\rho}(\rho)` :math:`F_{\rho}(\rho)` where the columns are separated by whitespace and :math:`F(\rho) = -dU(\rho)/d\rho`.
Arg *table/lin*  interpolates between entries in the the :math:`U` and :math:`F` columns linearly.
Similarly arg *table/spline* constructs a cubic spline for interpolation between grid points in each column.

Args *table/gradlin* and *table/gradspline* read in a file containing two columns.
E.g. for a SG potential, these two columns should be :math:`\rho` :math:`U_{\nabla}(\rho)` where the columns are separated by whitespace.
Arg *table/gradlin* interpolates between the :math:`U` column values linearly, and, based on the values passed in :math:`U`, constructs a :math:`F(\rho) = -dU/d\rho` with the corresponding delta interpolation.
Similarly, Arg *table/gradlin* constructs a cubic spline for interpolating between entries in the :math:`U` column provided, and then constructs a quadratic interpolation for the corresponding :math:`F(\rho) = -dU/d\rho`.
If a table formatted for *table/lin* or *table/spline* is passed under this command, only the first two columns will affect the simulation.

Note that in all tables the grid domain for the table spacing must be uniform.
Also for all tables, if the simulation ever encounters a particle with a local density outside the domain of values provided in the table, the simulation will exit with an error.
Accordingly, we advise providing values starting at a much lower/higher :math:`\rho` value than you expect to sample.
